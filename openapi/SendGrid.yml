        Suppressions are a list of email addresses that will not receive content
        sent under a given
        [group](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Suppression_Management/groups.html).

        global suppressions group.**


        A global suppression (or global unsubscribe) is an email address of a
        recipient who does not want to receive any of your messages. A globally
        suppressed recipient will be removed from any email you send. For more
        information, please see our [User

        The inbound parse webhook allows you to have incoming emails parsed,
        extracting some or all of the contnet, and then have that content POSTed
        by SendGrid to a URL of your choosing. For more information, please see

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the statistics for your Parse
        Webhook useage.**


        SendGrid's Inbound Parse Webhook allows you to parse the contents and
        attachments of incomming emails. The Parse API can then POST the parsed
        emails to a URL that you specify. The Inbound Parse Webhook cannot parse
        messages greater than 20MB in size, including all attachments.


        There are a number of pre-made integrations for the SendGrid Parse
        Webhook which make processing events easy. You can find these inte

        SendGrid’s Event Webhook will notify a URL of your choice via HTTP POST
        with information about events that occur as SendGrid processes your
        email.


        Common uses of this data are to remove unsubscribes, react to spam
        reports, determine unengaged recipients, identify bounced email
        addresses, or create advanced analytics of your email program.

        Use this method to enforce TLS encryption - this means that if the

        the message and send a block event with “TLS required but not supported”

        If the maximum number of cancellations/pauses are added, HTTP 400 will

        be returned.


        The Cancel Scheduled Sends feature allows the customer to cancel a
        scheduled send based on a Batch ID included in the SMTPAPI header.
        Scheduled sends cancelled less than 10 minutes before the scheduled time
        are not guaranteed to be cancelled.

        An authenticated domain allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on

        Authenticating a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your

        that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your

        The default branded link is the actual URL to be used when sending
        messages. If there are multiple branded links, the default is determined
        by the following order:

          Validated branded links marked as "default"
          Legacy branded links (migrated from the whitelabel wizard)
          Default SendGrid branded links (i.e. 100.ct.sendgrid.net)

        subuser.**


        Link branding can be associated with subusers from the parent account.
        This functionality allows

        subusers to send mail using their parent's link branding. To associate
        link branding, the parent account

        must first create a branded link and validate it. The parent may then
        associate that branded link with a subuser via the API or the Subuser
        Management page in the user interface.

      description: >-
        **This endpoint allows you to set up reverse DNS.**


        When setting up reverse DNS, use the same subdomain that you used when
        you authenticated your domain.


        Reverse DNS consists of a subdomain and domain that will be used to
        generate a reverse DNS record for a given IP. Once SendGrid has verified
        that the appropriate A record for the IP has been created, the
        appropriate reverse DNS record for the IP is generated.
